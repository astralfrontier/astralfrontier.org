# The Basic Meshj

There's several ways to build out a basic mesh for a character.

## Modeling and Sculpting

This is the use of the modeling tools to build a rough outline, then to use sculpting tools to refine it.

## Skin plus Subdivision

1. Create a skeletal human structure out of vertices and edges
2. Manually subdivide the edges
3. Add a Skin modifier
4. Add a Subdivision Surface modifier to give a more rounded shape
5. Use Mesh > Transform > Skin Resize (or Control-A) to grow or shrink the skin effect around edges or vertices
