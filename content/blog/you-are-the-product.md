I had a conversation with a friend about Internet advertising, and he used the same phrase I've often heard: "if you aren't buying something, you are the product".
I feel the whole situation is more complex than that phrase permits and I want to talk about why it bothers me.

<!-- more -->

For discussion purposes we'll talk about YouTube, which covers a lot of the bases I want to cover.
I'm going to name specific companies too, but that doesn't mean I know anything about them or what they're doing specifically - I just need names for illustrative purposes
but that really exist, so people can go look them up themselves.

### The Parties

In any situation where you're seeing online ads, there's actually five parties involved:

1. You
2. The service provider (e.g. YouTube)
3. The advertiser (e.g. Google AdSense, Mediavine)
4. The seller (e.g. Toyota)
5. Any regulatory entities, e.g. the government

Already we see a problem because "you are the product" implies "you're being sold to someone, by someone", and you ought to know who that is here.

### The Basics

The seller wants to sell their stuff. That's their goal. To do that, they need an audience to hear their sales pitch: "buy our stuff so you can be popular and sexy".
Toyota had a campaign called "Never Settle" about how their vehicles will enable you to go on adventures, and they'd like people to hear about it.

The advertiser wants the seller to hire them to do that job, because people who specialize in doing a thing (like advertising)
are better than people who don't (like folks who make vehicles). They'd like Toyota to pay them to place ads.

The service provider wants to get paid. If they can get paid by you (via YouTube Premium), wonderful. But they have to be paid by somebody.
They'll settle for the advertiser's money.

Ads are inherently annoying. Unless you went in search of an ad to watch on YouTube, the presence of an ad will be something you didn't ask for.
So the service provider wants to minimize the number of ads shown, but also wants to get paid.
So there's a balancing act - get paid by the advertiser, but don't show so many ads that the customers are driven away.

Service providers tend to charge for impressions, or eyeballs, or mouse clicks, or whatever term indicates that a person saw the ad and/or showed interest.
"We got your ad to the user," they tell the advertiser. But will that person buy, based on the ad?

Finally, all of these parties are subject to the regulations and laws of wherever they're operating. If you're in the EU, you have to comply with the GDPR.

### Demographics and Targeting

All of these factors - the advertiser's desire to keep costs low, the service provider's goal of keeping its customers happy and still getting paid -
lead to one conclusion:

"We should only show a given ad to people who want to see that sort of ad".

Well how do you do that?

**You learn about the people using the service.**

No duh, I hear you say. Hear me out.

This is really easy on services like Facebook. The whole point of Facebook is that you tell them everything about your life,
then keep sharing all these new details every day with all your friends.
As a result, Facebook can build these razor-sharp profiles about its users.

Google AdSense is similarly well equipped. If you use Gmail, if you gave Google demographic data about you,
if you've used Google Search, they know as much about you as you've told them.

At the same time, it's not like YouTube is telling every advertiser out there, "this is Marvin Minkins, he's into
heavy metal music videos and strap-ons".
Instead, what they tell advertisers is, "you can target customers on our service based on gender, these age ranges, and these locations,
because that's what we know about them".

The advertiser shrugs and fires its content shotgun at this weirdly-shaped wall the service provider has given them.
That's their job.

They'll go gather statistics about the effectiveness of the campaign, sure.
When you see shit like `utm_whatever` at the end of a URL, that's a tracking tag.
It tells the site you're going to about the site you came from, because advertisers want to know about that.
Similarly, YouTube now attaches a `si` parameter at the end of their video URLs.
That tells other properties about who shared the video - you - because they want to watch the spread of their stuff.
They want to know how well the advertising is working.

The seller doesn't give a shit about any of this. They're happier if the first time they hear about Marvin Minkins
is when he walks into a Toyota dealership with a pre-approved car loan.

### Bad Actors

There's all kinds of room for bad actors here.

The sellers can run bullshit ads. There's laws in place that constrain what ads can and can't say,
with or without a disclaimer.

The advertisers can send your phone to an app store to install something you'd rather not install and didn't want to install.
There's a million other ways to hijack a mobile device if you can push content onto it.
Even on a desktop system, ad content can engage in shenanigans, and ads can push themselves over other content.
Google's AdSense actually has a thing that lets you report when this happens, but it does happen.

The service provider is, of course, using whatever demographic data it has about you,
and better targeting of ads often means asking for more information.
Sometimes they'll gather too much, or expect too much, or gather something you didn't consent to tell them - like
inferring someone's location from their IP address.
Sites that can't effectively do this will often rely on networks like AdSense or Facebook's ad network,
which have already done this work.

### Ethics and Conclusion

Here's where I'm probably going to lose a lot of people.

You might look at all this and say "well I hate ads, so what are my ethical options?"

**You stop using the fucking service.**

**Or you pay them.**

There are people who will install ad blockers to watch YouTube,
but are fine watching videos for free.
They are receiving a benefit from a service, but are not interested in compensating the people providing it.

Right now I hear people warming up to say "it's ethical to get free service from megacorporations like Google"
and if you want to make that argument, that's great, at least you're fucking honest.

But if you're someone who says "well I shouldn't have to pay for this", and that's as far as you've thought about it,
I don't want to hear your slogans or your excuses.
If you want to be an ethical consumer of a service, either do it,
or clearly articulate an ethical position that includes "I don't have to pay people who do something for me".
