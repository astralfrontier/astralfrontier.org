This is a weekly recap of the games I'm in, or games that were talked about.
Here's where this week took me.

<!-- more -->

As usual, it was a week for cancellations. Last Sunday's Mechatron game didn't happen (and at this point, honestly, only really happens once every 1-2 months). I didn't run Tuesday for personal reasons. Thursday didn't happen because the GM hadn't prepped for a one-shot, and other players weren't feeling super amazing. We didn't have anything on the calendar Friday, because we're anticipating a new player and want to run a one-shot as a vibe check and because one player was out for family reasons.

That left Sunday Star Wars (using the [West End Games 1st Ed.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_The_Roleplaying_Game) rules), which has been increasingly fun. It's even more fun because there's two Jedi PCs out of three total, and I'm not one of them. So where are we there?

My character is a Smuggler named **Crow**. We have a Quixotic Jedi named **Charadan** - the son of a crime lord Crow owes money to - and a Failed Jedi named **Scoria**, who until recently kept her Force powers under wraps.

We just finished a job on Nar Shaddaa, bringing in a scumbag who had done Crow dirty in the past and deliver him to a syndicate on a water world. A member of Charadan's crime family, who the scumbag worked for and then betrayed, showed up to intercept us and bring the scumbag back to them instead of the syndicate.

Oh, and she wants to take Charadan back to take over the family business.

Okay, we can work with that. Crow does a tricky deal where the "nanny" and her super battle droid ride along with us, to see how Charadan actually performs as a crime lord. Everyone wins, or at least survives the encounter, except now we have someone on board who will definitely notice either of the Jedi PCs doing Jedi shit. Hooray for drama!

We're approached by a researcher from a previous job, who needs our help smuggling three coworkers and an important gizmo out from under Imperial noses. Fine, Crow comes up with a plan to distract the Imperials with another freighter and some religious pilgrims, and hopefully get the people out quietly.

Charadan's "nanny", however, has a talk with him about burnishing his leadership credentials. Charadan flat out asks Crow, "can I take credit for your plan?" Crow says no, but adds an important request to the refusal: "come up with your _own_ plan, in case mine fails."

The PCs also have an interesting talk about what the Jedi mean to them, and what it means to do "good". So overall, no amazing adventures, but an important character-centric session that set the stage for a fun and risky heist next time.
