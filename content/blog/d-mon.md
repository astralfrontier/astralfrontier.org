Since I feel like the core of Constellation Cards is in good shape (aside from some graphical design work),
I wanted to try building a custom deck.
I have a few ideas for fantasy settings, but what about something more... specific?

# The Pitch

> The government dubbed them D-MONS - Dimensional Monsters. The name itself was meant to frame their existence as something to be feared. When people saw some of us befriending them, working with them, they needed an explanation. "The D-Gene", it was called. Some special immutable quirk we just had, that could be studied or eliminated. They couldn't admit the truth, because our existence itself exposed their lie. What drew us and the MONs together wasn't genetics. It was mutual curiosity.

The premise of the D-MONS game is that "dimensional invaders" from electronic, quantum, and other realms of existence are coming to Earth.
But other types of beings are visiting as well.
They are dangerous, but not hostile.
And inevitably some human kids befriend them, gaining power to fight back against the invaders.

D-MONS is a sort of mashup of Digimon and suit tokusatsu franchises like Super Sentai and Kamen Rider.
It envisions "partner mons" who become the suits and giant robots operated by the human characters.
It focuses on the relationships between characters.

With that said, let's look at what goes into this.

# Character Cards

In Constellation Cards, you have three types of character cards: Focus, Role, and Upbringing.
We're doing away with Focus, because everyone has the same one - "partner mons".
Upbringing also goes away, in favor of a different view on social interactions.
So that leaves us with two new card types, in addition to the existing [Role cards](https://constellation.cards/stacks/character-role).

## Mon Cards

These cards represent a character's bond with their partner mon.
They can let you succeed at tasks with your partner's help, and are flipped back when you either indulge your partner's instincts, or find a way to rein them in.
Each of these cards is inspired by some kind of animal behavior.

- **Curious**. Everything is amazing! You have to check it all out - even if you distract yourself from one thing to go see another one. You can get lost in your own sense of wonder, even when important things need doing.
- **Fixated**. If you have a goal, you’ll pursue it. If you have a quarry, you’ll hunt it. Whatever catches your attention, you’ll see to it until it is done, whatever the cost - until you find your next fixation.
- **Imitative**. You try being different things, or picking up habits and behaviors by watching others.
- **Proud**. You have to be the biggest, baddest, and best around. You’ll use intimidation, dedication, or rarely deceit to claim and hold onto the admiration of others.
- **Quarrelsome**. You make yourself bigger - physically or psychologically - to ward off dangers. You might talk a big game, sling insults, or otherwise socially bristle as well, at anything or anyone who gets in your way.
- **Territorial**. This is yours. This thing, this person, this whatever. You’ll keep it safe from threats real or imagined. And you may not let it go, even if it wants to leave. Until you find something new, anyway.
- **Violent**. Your first instinct is to fight or destroy! You might wreck things instead of people, or have particular targets you like better, or prefer to play with your prey rather than just attack first.
- **Watchful**. You prefer stealth, cunning, and observation to direct confrontation. You might disappear unexpectedly, even when you’re needed, or surprise people with a sudden appearance out of nowhere.

## Passion Cards

These cards represent what your character wants.
Why do you do what you do? What motivates you?
Passion cards are more traditional character cards - you flip them to achieve something, then flip them back when their negatives come into play during the game.

- **Sensation**. You live to feel. You may create art, visit parks, ride rollercoasters, or do other things that deliver new experiences.
- **Knowledge**. You want to learn. You may practice a skill, read books, or train under someone.
- **Challenge**. You love competition against others, or just challenging yourself. Whether winning or just playing is more important, you’ll seek out new sport.
- **Compassion**. You want to see to the needs and wants of others, give people what they need, cheer them up, and otherwise play support.
- **Ambition**. You want power, money, recognition, or approval.
- **Refinement**. You want to engage in high-class behavior, dress in fine fashion, and associate with the best of the best.
- **Novelty**. You crave things at the fringes of normal experience. This might mean interest in weird, obscure, or occult topics, or just a deep fascination with a single ordinary thing.
- **Belonging**. You need to be part of something larger - a family, a club, a local restaurant, or somewhere else you can find purpose and social connection.

# Strain Cards

Since we're not interested in physically hurting kids on a regular basis, and because it's not really on-brand for our franchise mashup,
we're replacing Condition cards with a similar-in-spirit type of card called Strain.
Each Strain card represents a failure in a relationship. Each is based on a core human emotion.
You take Strain cards to succeed at a challenge, but you also have to talk about how that success came at an emotional cost.

- **Aversion**. One of you hurt the other, and now the offender is walking on eggshells around the victim, or unwilling to do something that used to come naturally. What will it take for this hurt to be healed?
- **Betrayal**. A promise was broken, even if one of you didn’t properly say it or only assumed it. If one party failed to uphold a promise, will they make it right or will their pride and fear interfere?
- **Disappointment**. Hopes were dashed, weakness was exposed, a facade was torn down. It’s hard to accept the reality underneath.
- **Disdain**. One of you hoped the other would like something, but it didn’t turn out that way at all. That hurt, and now you’re both not sure what to do.
- **Hopelessness**. One of you is standing in the way of another’s hopes and dreams. Maybe it’s for the best (one of you thinks), but either way, the other is left feeling like there’s nowhere to go. How will things start moving again?
- **Hostility**. A fight broke out - or almost did - and now everyone’s tempers are running hot. Any reconciliation must overcome this lingering emotion, and failure means renewed hostility.
- **Misunderstanding**. One or more people got the wrong idea, and nobody is putting it right. Either someone doesn’t know, or thinks the worst.
- **Rejection**. You wanted to make a connection but were turned away. Maybe they didn’t have time or energy, maybe they didn’t understand, maybe something else. But now there’s distance between you.

## Strain Examples

Alice and Bob are both characters who are close friends.
Alice needs to get something important done, but she has no character cards that can serve her (or she prefers to take a Strain card).
Her player and Bob's agree that she was going to meet Bob for some important personal time, but Alice blows Bob off to do her thing.
Alice takes the Aversion card.
Bob is left waiting, Alice realizes it, and now she's reluctant to talk to Bob as a friend because she knows she hurt his feelings.
