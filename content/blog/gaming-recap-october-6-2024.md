Ski lodge supervillains and Star Wars heists dominated this week's gaming. Let's find out what happened and what I thought about it.

<!-- more -->

I canceled Tuesday yet again, but here's hoping next week is the one. It's frustrating to have recurring health and sleep issues.

For Thursday, we played the second part of the [White Out](@/blog/gaming-recap-september-29-2024.md) adventure in Sentinsl Comics RPG.
We had an interesting setup: my perpetually poor gadgeteer Leo Snow was being shown around a tech expo hosted at a ski lodge,
when a supervillain attack threatened the attendees.
The second half was our fight against the villain himself.

Entertainingly, all four parties - the three PCs and the villain - used technology,
and three of the four used actual power suits.
Despite this, each of the characters played very differently.

The GM created the character sheets this time, as with our first outing with the system.
I don't think I would have created the character the way it was done here,
but I also have very particular ideas about how my characters work.
It looks like we'll be making characters ourselves next time, and I'm looking forward to it.

I pitched five characters from my catalog:

* **Alex Shelby**, aka "Agent 1337" and later "Comrade X", a recurring character from my Menagerie fiction and the Masks-616 game we played years ago. A playful, pop-culture-obsessed hacker with cybernetic implants and sass.
* **Gogo**, a high school kid who drank a stolen super-soldier serum and gained the ability to turn into a human-galago hybrid. Plays like a furry Spider-man.
* **Rivet**, a good-natured not-so-ex-villain with ferrokinesis (metal manipulation). He's cheerful, naive about mundane matters, and is deeply broken but means well.
* **Exodus**, a fun-loving teleporter with extremely vague notions about personal property and crime. In some of my super worlds, he's a villain; he's flexible enough to play both hero and villain.
* **Sabine**, a blind speedster from the unfinished Silverline fiction. She's got vibration-related superpowers, and is a little arrogant and a lot adventurous.

On Friday, we were missing a player and didn't have a one-shot scheduled.
One of the players improvised a game on the spot, set in a low-fantasy Medieval setting.
I played Wymond, a monk somewhere between Brother Cadfael and Brendan from "The Secret of Kells".
He was the third son of a nobleman, and had a brief career as a soldier before turning to religious observance.
His monastery was sacked by Viking-like invaders and he fled, alone, to the starting village of the game.
During the game, we learned that those invaders had grown closer. It looks like the PCs will have to resist them. Next time...

For Sunday, we got to the first part of the [Farhaven Heist](@/blog/gaming-recap-september-22-2024.md) in the Star Wars game.
Our job is to smuggle three researchers and a one-ton gizmo off a space station, out from under Imperial surveillance.
My Smuggler character Crow has a plan, and for the most part it went smoothly - until it didn't.
Now we have to get a few people out of the hands of an Imperial inquisitor,
save a Force-sensitive fugitive, and figure out how to salvage this situation.

Which is exactly what a good Star Wars adventure should be like.
