This setting is an attempt to create:

- A multi-planetary high-fantasy/high-technology setting, inspired by franchises such as Final Fantasy
- A system of planets created as rough fantasy analogues of our Solar system.
- Physical, magical, and moral conflicts that donâ€™t re-invoke colonialism or historical bigotry
- A flexible but consistent magic system that permits a wide range of practices & disciplines

# Storytelling Principles

- The wonders and terrors of power matched with ambition
- There are no Chosen Ones or fated heroes, but there are bloodlines and inheritances that can affect one's future
- Multiple protagonists or viewpoint characters. This is a world beyond a single person's perspective
- People don't need to be conquered or guided, but freed
- A sense of continuity and history - the past and present influence each other, and in turn shape the future
- There can be inequality and intolerance, but it will never be gratuitous or done for "historical accuracy". This isn't history, but fantasy

# Elements

- High fantasy, high technology, but not necessarily at the same time or in the same place
- Multiple physical planets, with multiple ways to travel between them
- Multiple cultures, colors, species. No blatant ripoffs of existing cultures, no appropriation - instead, strive to make something both original and authentic
- Artifacts of culture - art, music, sports. All the stuff other than the usual combat/magic/exploration focus

# Metaphysics

- Gods, perhaps, but only in the sense of "ineffable cosmic beings", rather than creatures inherently deserving worship or obedience
- An underlying power source - **Luma** - that gives rise to numerous magical or mystical disciplines
