# Calling-Specific Rest Actions

Every calling has a specific Rest Action they can perform. See p. 45 for details on Rest Actions

- **Astromancer**: When you Play a Game using divination tools (e.g. Tarot cards), instead of the usual benefit, you can receive a vision about a person or place (as per the Starry Divinations Talent). If the vision pertains to someone with whom you have a Bond, you can ensure the secret is immediately beneficial if either the person is participating in the scrying, or if you stress the bond.
- **Chanter**: You can engage in the following behaviors. If you do, you gain the effects of the corresponding Talent until your next Rest Action.
  - Fasting and self-abnegation: Binding of Five
  - Soul-baring confessions of helplessness and pleas for safety from your Speakers: Protective Eidolons
  - Righteous accusations against the gods for their neglect toward mankind: Shattered Seals
- **Raconteur**: When you Entertain by speaking about a particular person, in addition to the other benefits, you conjure the shade of that person as a Familiar (per the Witch talent). The shade will accompany and assist you until the next Rest Action you take.
- **Arklight**: If you participate in a rest action with anyone else and any of you clear a Stressed Bond involving another participant, gain 1 Grit in addition to the normal benefits of the action.
- **Champion**: You engage in brisk, beneficial physical exercise. You, and everyone who joins in with you, gains +1 RB until their next long rest.
- **Shadowblade**: If you Scavenge or Stand Watch, or otherwise actively isolate yourself from the group, the solitude brings you a measure of inner peace. Clear 1 Stressed Bond as well as gain the benefit of the action, as long as nobody else assists you.
- **Draloi**: When you perform First Aid, Sacrifice 3 HP to either reduce the difficulty of the Recovery test by 3 (as though you'd spent Grit), or to heal an extra 3 HP. You may make this decision before or after the roll.
- **Psythe**: You can establish a Psychic Network with the group, as per the Talent. Every participant stays in the network until the next time they sleep, as the link consumes the same psychic space as dreams. Anyone who spends their Rest Action participating in the setup can speak through the network; anyone else may only receive messages.
- **Rune Magus**: You can expend double the number of atheric crystals during Coalescence to gain Advantage on the Create test.
