# Martial Arts Styles

You can attach the following Mod to any weapon, and it does not consume a Mod slot.

**Style**. This weapon is actually mastery of a single martial arts style. This has the following effects:

- Characters may roll the Grappling Maneuver move with their weapon dice.
- You can use the style with signature weapons or unarmed, but there's no mechanical distinction.
- It should be about as easy to detect or interfere with a style aetherically as it is to do the same to a physical weapon, via pressure point manipulation, magic, artifacts, etc.
- The weapon's presence is always obvious to skilled fighters or people with keen aetheric senses, as practicing styles always changes the fighter's aether.

In general:

- Light vs. Heavy helps determine whether a style is hard/external or light/internal, but this distinction can mean other things.
- Ranged styles exist. This can mean attacks with energy blasts, use of bow & arrow or thrown darts, etc.

## Example styles

**Starry Serpent Style**. Light, Melee, Accurate, Venomous, Style. Modeled on the quick motions of the snake, and drawing power from a serpentine constellation in the night sky, Practitioners use footwork, deceptive hand strikes, and targeted hits against opponents' pressure points to disable and destroy.

**Tiger's Paw Style**. Heavy, Melee, Deadly, Execution, Style. A hard-hitting style developed by a cabal of bounty hunters, doctors, and revolutionaries. The style excels at defeating armored targets - such as those sent after anti-Imperial spies.

**Soul Lightning Style**. Light, Ranged, Magickal, Umbral, Style. A martial art designed to fight possessed targets, ghosts, and other spiritual opponents. It channels the wielder's aether through specific motions and stances and into one or more opponents like a mystic lightning bolt, and can chain from target to target if aimed properly.
