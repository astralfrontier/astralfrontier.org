### New Talents (Tier 2)

A lot of the MMORPG abilities can be built from the following template: "Pick a particular magical action and set of modifiers, and reduce the difficulty of using it by 1".

Although these are listed by job, anyone with an appropriate Aether skill can attempt using them. Examples are provided, but you can build your own. Note that the talent is not required to cast these spells! Having the talent just makes casting it easier.
