A Face is a specific type of Non-Protagonist Character (or ”Non-Player Character” or ”NPC”, run by a game’s facilitator). A Face is a person in the story who serves as a narrative proxy for something intangible or impersonal, like a religion, a social movement, or a government. Through interacting with the Face, we learn about what they represent, called the Locus. At the same time, a Face is still an individual, and has their own hopes, dreams, and motivations. For example, in ”Star Wars”, Darth Vader can be seen as one Face of the Empire. Vader is powerful and does bad things, and so does the Empire. But the Empire doesn’t have a son, while Vader does, and that fact changes the Empire through Vader killing the Emperor.
