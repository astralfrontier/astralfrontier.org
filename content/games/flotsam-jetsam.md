You were aboard an Aethership, traveling between worlds. The emergency bell sounded - collision! - splintering wood and fracturing crystal - chaos - and screams.

You've collided with another Aethership, in a void so vast that such a thing should be impossible. But it happened. Now you and the rest of the crew from both ships need to survive, salvage what you can, and hope for a rescue.
