# Story

- There is a small flat-bottomed barge that carries cargo and passengers across a wild river
- The party is ready to set sail - or come ashore? - when enemies attack

# Possible Objectives

- Find (or destroy) cargo contained in a crate, before an enemy gets to it
- Rescue someone from the barge and bring them ashore (or vice versa)
- Get all enemies off the riverboat, at which time it can set sail

# Possible Enemies

- All types of enemies, coming from shore
- Pirates or fishpeople, who emerge from the water

# Tactics

- The map is broadly divided into two parts: shore and the riverboat
- The crane and stacked cargo are the harder path onto or off of the boat, but the crane offers a perch for ranged attackers
- The boarding ramp is an easy chokepoint, but the gap between the boat and shore is narrow enough to leap with effort
- The wheelhouse and cargo on deck offer defenders cover
- There are few cover options on shore, but the height advantage may compensate for that
