# Story

- In the middle of a forest, a dried-up creek has formed a pathway
- A fallen log rests over part of the path

# Possible Objectives

- Locate an item lost in the forest
- Dig up an item buried somewhere off the path

# Possible Enemies

- Forest sprites or elementals
- Goblin bandits

# Tactics

- The map is divided into three parts: the left bank, the right bank, and the center path
- The two banks are accessible via ramps, but there's one fewer ramp on one side
- The banks are otherwise too far apart to leap over the gap
- The fallen log connects both banks, but it's a chokepoint
- The more accessible bank has several elevated points

# Tiles

- The flowing water tiles are **Charged**
- The fallen log tiles **Obscuring**
