  The Fearless Dragon Slayers!
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong></strong></p>
<p>Twenty years ago, the last known Dragon disappeared from the land. Since then, numerous heroes have claimed credit for finding and slaying others. Your group are traveling entertainers. You're no good at killing dragons, but you're great at telling stories, and there's money to be made when people think you're a hero. What's the harm? The dragons are gone, and everyone else is doing well these days.</p>
<p>You're setting up for your third day's show in a sleepy valley village, when a dragon bursts forth from a distant mountain and takes to the sky. The villagers look at you expectantly.</p>
<p>What do you do?</p>
<p>Using an elegant d4 system, create a troupe of entertainers in over their head. Decide when lies or truth will serve you better, and find a way to do the impossible - save a village from a dragon.</p>
