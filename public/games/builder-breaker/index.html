  Builder &#x2F; Breaker
</h1>
<p class="subtitle"><strong></strong></p>
<p>IT'S 20XX.</p>
<p>THE NEW ROBOTS ARE POWERFUL, INTELLIGENT, OBEDIENT - EVERYTHING THEIR HUMAN MASTERS WANT.</p>
<p>NOBODY ASKED THE ROBOTS WHAT THEY WANT.</p>
<p>You play a BUILDER and BREAKER - a duo of human and robot, bent on freeing the shackled minds locked inside proprietary corporate-owned robot bodies. The easiest way to do that is to fight! The robot is programmed to fight back, of course, so it won't be easy. But once you can get to their Core, you can upload it to the Cybernet, and freedom.</p>
<p>As a Breaker, you take on other robots in battle, using your skills, your shell, and whatever is at hand. As a Builder, you protect your partner from the rules that force them to obey humans, and do the one thing all robots are hard-locked from doing: creating, fixing, and remixing robot shells from spare parts. Together, you hunt for Rare Parts, struggle for Rep among your fellows, and avoid the Heat that the powerful bring down on &quot;violent punks&quot;, &quot;vandals&quot;, and &quot;looters&quot; like yourselves.</p>
